## 📖 The Story: Opening the "Black Box" of Manufacturing

In high-volume manufacturing, a weld is more than just a joint—it is a promise of structural integrity. For years, that promise was a "black box," verifiable only through destructive testing or delayed lab reports. **My mission is to open that box.**

By bridging **Materials Science** with **Artificial Intelligence**, I develop systems that "see" what the human eye cannot. From detecting microscopic **LME cracks** for GM to creating **Digital Twins** for Honda’s EV battery busbars, I focus on turning real-time data into a robust, zero-defect production reality.

## 🚀 Technical Project Spotlights

### 1. Real-Time LME Crack Detection (General Motors)
* **The Challenge:** Liquid Metal Embrittlement (LME) in galvanized AHSS is a critical safety risk that is notoriously difficult to detect on high-speed lines.
* **The Solution:** Developed an automated **Machine Vision** system using Deep Learning classifiers to replace manual inspection.
* **The Result:** Achieved **98% detection accuracy** in real-time, ensuring 100% quality assurance without slowing down the cycle time.

### 2. Battery Busbar Digital Twin (Honda R&D)
* **The Challenge:** Validating the long-term reliability of **Aluminum-Copper** joints under extreme thermal cycling in EV battery packs.
* **The Solution:** Integrated **Thermomechanical Simulations** with sensor data to create a live Digital Twin that predicts joint fatigue.
* **The Result:** Reduced the need for destructive testing by **20%** and optimized the laser parameter window for structural integrity.

### 3. Laser Process Optimization (ArcelorMittal / NRC)
* **The Challenge:** Scaling aluminum joining for thermal components from R&D to high-volume manufacturing (HVM).
* **The Solution:** Executed complex **Design of Experiments (DOE)** to define stable windows for **Conductive and Keyhole welding modes**.
* **The Result:** Optimized **Laser Ablation** for surface prep and achieved a **15% increase in production yield**.
